ðŸ“¦ Requirements & Their Purpose

1. faiss
What is it?
FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
Why is it used?
It's used to store and search through high-dimensional text embeddings efficiently. When a user asks a question, FAISS quickly finds the most relevant documents from the dataset.


2. sentence-transformers
What is it?
A Python library for creating sentence embeddings using pre-trained transformer models like MiniLM, BERT, etc.

Why is it used?
You used it to convert textual restaurant data (e.g., menu items, policies) into dense vectors for similarity search with FAISS.

Model Used:
sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2

A lightweight and fast model ideal for semantic search tasks.
It produces high-quality sentence embeddings with minimal resource usage.


3. transformers
What is it?
A library from Hugging Face that provides access to pre-trained language models like GPT, BERT, etc.

Why is it used?
You used it to load and run DialoGPT-small, a conversational model that generates natural language responses.

Model Used:
microsoft/DialoGPT-small

A fine-tuned version of GPT-2 optimized for dialogues and chatbot interactions.
Used to generate human-like responses based on the retrieved data and user query.


4. numpy
What is it?
A fundamental library for numerical operations in Python.
Why is it used?
Used for array manipulation, vector calculations, and general numerical processing during embedding and search operations.


5. gradio (Optional, if used for interface)
What is it?
A tool to create interactive UIs for ML models quickly.
Why is it used?
If youâ€™ve created a web interface for your chatbot, Gradio helps users interact with the bot easily via a simple web app.
